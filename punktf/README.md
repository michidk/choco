# A cross-platform multi-target dotfiles manager

## Yet another dotfile manager?!

Well, yes, but hear me out: This project was driven by the personal need of having to manage several dotfiles for different machines/targets. You want the same experience everywhere: On your Windows workstation along with an Ubuntu WSL instance, your Debian server and your private Arch installation. This tool fixes that problem while being cross-platform and blazingly fast. You won't need multiple sets of dotfile configurations ever again!

## Features

- Compile and deploy your dotfiles with one command across different platforms
- Use handlebar-like instructions to insert variables and compile sections conditionally
- Define pre- and post-hooks to customize the behavior with your own commands
- Create multiple profiles for different targets
- Works on Windows and Linux
