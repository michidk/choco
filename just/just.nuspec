    <description><![CDATA[`just` is a handy way to save and run project-specific commands.

This readme is also available as a [book](https://just.systems/man/en/).

(中文文档在 [这里](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/README.中文.md), 快看过来!)

Commands, called recipes, are stored in a file called `justfile` with syntax inspired by `make`:

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casey/just/master/screenshot.png)

You can then run them with `just RECIPE`:

```sh
$ just test-all
cc *.c -o main
./test --all
Yay, all your tests passed!
```

`just` has a ton of useful features, and many improvements over `make`:

- `just` is a command runner, not a build system, so it avoids much of [`make`'s complexity and idiosyncrasies](#what-are-the-idiosyncrasies-of-make-that-just-avoids). No need for `.PHONY` recipes!

- Linux, MacOS, and Windows are supported with no additional dependencies. (Although if your system doesn't have an `sh`, you'll need to [choose a different shell](#shell).)

- Errors are specific and informative, and syntax errors are reported along with their source context.

- Recipes can accept [command line arguments](#recipe-parameters).

- Wherever possible, errors are resolved statically. Unknown recipes and circular dependencies are reported before anything runs.

- `just` [loads `.env` files](#dotenv-integration), making it easy to populate environment variables.

- Recipes can be [listed from the command line](#listing-available-recipes).

- Command line completion scripts are [available for most popular shells](#shell-completion-scripts).

- Recipes can be written in [arbitrary languages](#writing-recipes-in-other-languages), like Python or NodeJS.

- `just` can be invoked from any subdirectory, not just the directory that contains the `justfile`.

- And [much more](https://just.systems/man/en/)!
